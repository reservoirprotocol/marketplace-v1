10.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Uneven Labs and the other Uneven Labs Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even if Uneven Labs or the other Uneven Labs Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

12.1 We may update, amend, alter, or modify these Terms in the future. You agree that Uneven Labs may make changes to these Terms at any time and for any reason at its sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you and give you an opportunity to review the new Terms that will supersede and replace these Terms.

13.3 We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use the Services.
    

# 14. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration.
    

14.1 Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Uneven Labs and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.
    
14.2 No Representative Actions. You agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Uneven Labs and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
    
14.3 Arbitration of Disputes. Except for disputes in which you or Uneven Labs seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and Uneven Labs waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against Uneven Labs you agree to first contact Uneven Labs and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Uneven Labs by email at legal@unevenlabs.com. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Uneven Labs cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to confidential, binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the State of Florida by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You and Uneven Labs agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Uneven Labs, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
    
14.4 You and Uneven Labs agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee up to a maximum of $250, and Uneven Labs will pay the remaining fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Uneven Labs, Uneven Labs will pay all fees and costs. You and Uneven Labs agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Florida shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
    
14.5 Any dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Uneven Labs will not have the right to assert the claim.
    
14.6 You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by contacting Uneven Labs at legal@unevenlabs.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 15.
    
14.7 If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 14 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 14; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 14 will be enforceable.
    

  
  

# 15. Governing Law and Venue.
    

15.1 Any dispute arising from these Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the courts of the State of Florida or federal courts of the Middle District of Florida.
    

# 16. Severability.
    

16.1 If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    

# 17. Feedback.
    

17.1 You may voluntarily post, submit or otherwise communicate to us, including through third party channels (e.g., Discord), any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, original or creative materials or other information about the Services (collectively, “Feedback”). By posting or submitting any Feedback to us, you hereby irrevocably grant to Uneven Labs a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, and fully sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Feedback (in whole or in part) in any media and to incorporate the Feedback into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed. You understand that Uneven Labs may treat Feedback as nonconfidential.
    

# 18. Miscellaneous.
    

18.1 The failure of Uneven Labs to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements and understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.
